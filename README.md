# fritzy

A small project to gather internet-stats from a fritz-box

## how to develop

The `.env.template` file acts as a template for the needed `.env` file.
Because of some current limitations you have to copy that file to all underlying components to be able to use the values that are set up there.

### scripts

The _scripts_ are written in Python 3, so you have to install Python v3.  
To prepare your environment, run the following from the `./src/scripts/` directory:

```powershell
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

To run it, run the following from the `./src/scripts/` directory:

```powershell
python exec.py
```

As `exec.py` kinda acts like a chron-job that runs every morning at 3 AM, to debug, you'd have to change the interval when the underlying script is called.
Alternatively you can also run the underlying script directly, by runnin the following from the `./src/scripts/` directory:

```powershell
python -c 'import fritzy; fritzy.execute()'
```

### server

The _server_ portion is written using NodeJS version 18, so you have to install NodeJS v18 or later.  
To prepare your environment, run the following from the `./src/server/` directory:

```powershell
npm install
```

To run the _server_ locally, you simply have to run the following from the `./src/server/`:

```powershell
node server.js
```

### website

The _website_ is simply written in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. So to run it, you simply have to open the `./src/website/index.html` file in your favourite browser.  
To host the website in a docker-container NGINX is used.

## how to setup your fritz-box and fritzy

To setup your fritz-box and fritzy to enable gathering data from the web, you have to do the following:

1. Enable "MyFRITZ!" and create an account under `https://fritz.box/#mfSet` (_Internet -> MyFRTIZ! Account_)
2. Enable internet-access for that account and choose which users can access your fritz-box from the internet
3. For this you can optionally create a new user under `https://fritz.box/#user` (_System -> FRITZ!Box Users_). The user has to have all permissions enabled (except for "Access to NAS contents" and "VPN") and needs to be allowed to connect from the internet
4. Under `https://fritz.box/#mfSet` (_Internet -> MyFRTIZ! Account_) you should also enable "Internet access to the FRITZ!Box via HTTPS enabled"
5. To connect to your fritz-box you can now use the address presented under "MyFRITZ! internet access". This is the address you have to use in your `.env` in `FRITZ_BASE_URL`
6. If you created a separate user for the internet-access you have to place that user-name and password in your `.env` under `FRITZ_USER` and `FRITZ_PASSWORD`
7. Other values in your `.env` don't need to be changed, so you're good to go. Enjoy! ðŸš€

## how to run

first you have to rename `.env.template` to `.env` and enter the values that fit your needs.  
  
to run you simply have to use `docker-compose` like so:  

```bash
docker compose -f ./src/docker-compose.yml up --build -d
```

to stop the docker-containers simply use:

```bash
docker compose -f ./src/docker-compose.yml stop
```

and to remove the docker-containers entirely use:

```bash
docker compose -f ./src/docker-compose.yml down
```
